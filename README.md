In this game, a random target number is assigned. The player's goal is to reach a score equal to this target number without going over. The player's score is determined by clicking on the crystals. Each crystal has a randomly assigned value. The player will only find out the crystal's value after it has been clicked. Each crystal clicked will increase the player's score by the amount of the crystal's value.

### Instructions

* Click on one of the crystals to see it's value. Your score will increase by the value of that crystal.

* The player wins if their score matches the target number. If the player's score is larger than the target, they lose.

* Once the player has won or lost, a new game will begin.
